Case statements are SQL's version of an "IF this THEN that" statement. Case statements have three parts -- a WHEN clause, a THEN clause, and an ELSE clause. The first part -- the WHEN clause -- tests a given condition, say, x = 1. If this condition is TRUE, it returns the item you specify after your THEN clause. You can create multiple conditions by listing WHEN and THEN statements within the same CASE statement. The CASE statement is then ended with an ELSE clause that returns a specified value if all of your when statements are not true. When you have completed your statement, be sure to include the term END and give it an alias. The completed CASE statement will evaluate to one column in your SQL query.
